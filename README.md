# üì© SMS Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

## üß† Overview

This project is a **machine learning-based SMS Spam Detection system** developed in **Python**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify text messages into two categories: **spam** and **ham** (non-spam). The model uses a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier trained on a public SMS dataset and is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

It serves as a practical demonstration of using text classification in real-world applications such as email filters, messaging apps, and customer support automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook 
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äì Data visualization
  - `sklearn` ‚Äì Model training, testing, and evaluation
- **Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes (from `sklearn.naive_bayes`)
- **Dataset**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Loading**  
  - The SMS dataset is loaded directly from a GitHub URL.
  - It includes SMS text messages labeled as either spam or ham.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - The text messages are assigned column names (`label`, `message`).
   - Labels are converted to numeric format: `spam` ‚Üí 1, `ham` ‚Üí 0.

3. **Text Vectorization**
   - Text messages are converted into numeric form using `CountVectorizer` (Bag-of-Words approach).

4. **Model Training**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
   - A **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model is trained on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - The model is tested on unseen data.
   - Metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are generated.
   - A heatmap of the confusion matrix is visualized using `seaborn`.
